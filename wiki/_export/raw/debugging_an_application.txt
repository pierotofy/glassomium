====== Debugging an Application ======

The best way to test your applications before trying them out within Glassomium is by using [[http://www.chromium.org/|Chromium]] (or Google Chrome). You can use another browser if you'd like, but keep in mind that Glassomium windows are rendered with Chromium.

To access your application, simply start the UI Server and connect to http://localhost:5555/apps/NameOfYourApp/

If you are developing a multi touch application and would like to simulate TUIO events with the mouse, pass the following parameters to the URL: http://localhost:5555/apps/NameOfYourApp/?development=1&simulate_tuio=1

The development=1 flag will instruct the UI Server to include the contents of /server/JS/injectOnLoad.js while the simulate_tuio=1 will include some code that takes in mouse events and converts them into TUIO touchstart, touchmove and touchend events.
