====== Using a web server with Glassomium ======

The UI Server only supports the generation of dynamic content via [[Create a UI Server plugin|plugins]] using the Ruby language. If you want to develop with PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails and so forth, simply install and configure a web server (Apache, IIS, etc.) on your machine (or a remote one) and launch your applications by creating redirects. For example, if you want to launch a PHP application that is located on http://yourserver/myapp, simply create a new application in the /server/WebRoot/apps/myapp and place the following code in your index.html:

<code html>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<script>
document.addEventListener('GLALoad', onGLALoad, false);
function onGLALoad(event) {
	location.href='http://yourserver/myapp';
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
</code>

Note that we capture the GLALoad event to switch the location. Using a traditional body onload **might** work, but racing conditions could happen. It's just safer to do it this way.
