** Changelog for 0.4 **
   * Improved speed calculation for windows' drag physics
   * Fixed a bug that was causing windows to disappear outside the screen if dragged too close to the edge while physics effects were enabled
   * Minimize feature added. Now windows can be minimized by dragging them toward the borders of the screen.

** Changelog for 0.3 **
   * More compatible touch events. Now DOM elements receive the events before the document object.
   * Added Box2d physics drag. Now windows can have momentum when released from a drag.
   * Improved dragging. Now adding/removing a touch while dragging a window will not cause a sudden shift.
   * New demo applications including Glow Hockey, Checkers, Chess, Feed The Panda (Cut the rope clone) and Movie Player.
   * Fixed heap overflow bug while maximizing a window.
   * Fixed race conditions that were causing display issues during animations.
   * Removed system menus, now applications can be closed by a pinch gesture.
   * Removed GLA.SetMenuButtons API.
   * Added aspect ratio option in the configuration for applications.
   * Faster input and rendering for fullscreen applications!
   * Improved the transitions to fullscreen (now fades instead of scaling).
   * Fixed the default theme's navigator size.
   * Improved deallocation of windows that were causing crashes due to racing conditions.
