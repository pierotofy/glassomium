====== Managing Applications ======

==== Where are my apps? ====

On Windows, press the Window Key + R, then from the Run dialog type %appdata%\Glassomium\server\WebRoot\apps and press enter. You will be redirected to the directory where Glassomium's applications are stored. 

On Linux simply browse to the location where you have installed Glassomium and open the server/WebRoot/apps directory.

==== Deleting an application ====

You can delete an application by simply deleting the directory that contains it

==== Adding an application ====

You can add a new application by creating a new folder and by providing an index.html as well as a assets/icon.png. More information on creating applications is provided on [[Create a simple Hello World application|this page]]. You don't have to be an HTML wizard to create an application. Chances are that the application you need already exists somewhere on the web.
